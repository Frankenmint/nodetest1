#Express basic CRUD application

It's been awhile since I've had a chance to touch Express so I
thought it's a good time to do an exercise to remember how to wire
up a basic CRUD service.

###Todo's
* create a PUT service to modify the entry.
* add some tests (I know, I should have done TDD but it's hard when working alone.)
* think of some more features to add.
